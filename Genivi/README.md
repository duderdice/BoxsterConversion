# Genivi 
The GENIVI Alliance is a non-profit automotive industry alliance committed to driving the broad adoption of an In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) open-source development platform.


# Genivi Demo Platform (GDP)
The GENIVI Demo Platform is a technology demonstrator which showcases a concrete and live incarnation of the GENIVI software and design, and is made available as a starter kit that can be publicly downloaded and customized by the wider developer community.


# Build script
The build script here at the root level of the Genivi project is designed to make it very easy to pull the source, build the code, and run the emulator for the GDP.  Note, this script is written for my system (Ubuntu Linux x86-64) so the script may require modifications if you are running on another platform.
