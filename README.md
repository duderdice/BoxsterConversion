# BoxsterConversion

This project is intended to provide an easy way to aggregate, manage, and share the content related to the conversion of my 2004 Porsche Boxster to electric drive.  This may include a basic website to share information (diagrams, notes, links, blogs, etc.) as well as potentially binary documents that may be relevant to the conversion.  Hopefully this facilitates brainstorming and record keeping thru the course of the conversion process.
