Beagle Bone Black (BBB)
===

## About ##
This low-cost device is analagous to an Arduino, readily available, low-cost (~$35), well supported and, best of all, runs a full Linux environment.  It can also runs BoneScript, which is a NodeJS powered JavaScript programming environment for embedded device.  This means it can be easily programmed in JavaScript to perform various tasks controlling input/output pins on the board.  All of these factors make me believe it has a role to play in the Boxster conversion project, whether to drive the main touchscreen display in the vehicle (ala Tesla), or perhaps playing the role of the BCU (body control unit - managing environmental controls and pretty much everything other than the drivetrain) in concert with the GEVCU's role as ECU (engine control unit - managing the drivetrain).  


## Usage ##
Still trying to figure out where & how I want to make use of it in the project, so stay tuned for more detail...


## Misc ##

* [Adafruit.com](http://www.adafruit.com/category/75) => I buy my BBB stuff from here because they do a great job of providing all necessary components, knowledge, and feedback to the manufacturer to help improve the product over time and make sure the folks who purchase it are equipped for success.

* [Bone Collar](./collar_giveaway.pdf) =>  Thank you to Simon Monk who made these cool  printouts which describe the pins on the board so its easy to know when wiring them up.

* [BeagleBoneBlack DIN clips](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:802374) => If you want to mount your BBB on a DIN rail, some generous folks have modeled and uploaded to Thingiverse the pieces needed to 3D-print your own DIN clips which match the mounting holes on the BBB circuit board.  This can probably be adapted or lead you to mounts for a fully enclosed case as well, if you don't want the board exposed.
